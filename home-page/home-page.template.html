<h4>About Me:</h4>
<p>
  I'm a Junior Undergraduate student at UCI, studying Computer Science. My
  primary work so far is in Application development, on the web using frameworks
  such as angular.js, and on mobile via Android Studio. Check out some of my
  work on my <a href="https://github.com/krayskiy">github page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Despite that, theres yet to be a field in programming that doesn't interest
  me! I have experience with multiple programming languages, including Python,
  C++, Java, and C#. I enjoy testing my algorithm knowledge with challenges from
  LeetCode and HackerRank. And I'm always eager to learn more. Don't hesitate to
  contact me at rayskiyklim@gmail.com.
